# s4607_extra
Extra utilities for working with Stanag 4607 data that don't really belong in the core library (s4607). As an example, a useful query function to extract a particular subset of fields from the hierarchical packet structure would belong here not in the core.

# Dependencies
This library is designed to work with s4607, and a compiled copy of this code is required. This dependency is not currently handled automatically, but will be in the future.
